# Walmart Sales Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the Walmart Sales Forecasting project! This project aims to predict weekly sales for various departments across multiple Walmart stores using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

We use the 'Walmart Store Sales Forecasting' dataset from Kaggle, which includes weekly sales data for 45 stores and 99 departments over a 3-year period. The dataset contains store-specific information, geographical factors, promotional markdowns, and other relevant features.

## Data Exploration

We start by exploring the dataset to identify key characteristics and relevant features. This initial analysis helps us gain insights into the data.

## Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for modeling, we perform data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables, and merging multiple datasets into a unified dataset suitable for model training.

## Prediction Models

We employ four machine learning algorithms for sales prediction:

- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

Each algorithm is implemented and fine-tuned to provide accurate sales forecasts.

## Comparative Analysis

We conduct a comparative analysis of the four algorithms to determine which one performs the best for sales forecasting. This analysis includes evaluating accuracy, precision, and other relevant metrics.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project offers a robust solution for Walmart's sales forecasting needs. We successfully implement and compare four machine learning algorithms, with the Decision Tree Regressor showing outstanding accuracy. These algorithms can potentially achieve even better results with improved hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Utilizing this forecasting system can provide valuable insights and enhance decision-making.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
